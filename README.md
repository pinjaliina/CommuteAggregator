# CommuteAggregator
A project to calculate aggregated travel times based on Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix (HRTTM)

This application calculates aggregated travel times as reported by the HRTTM. The actual commutes that are to be aggregated are taken from the Finnish Monitoring System of Spatial Structure and Urban Form (MSSSUF or just SSUF; fi: YKR).
